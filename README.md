# Lease

Trying to simplify the lease pdf/html management

## Usage

On any model you want to treat as a "signer" of an envelope/template, add `leasable` to create an association to both envelopes and templates:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord

  leasable

end
```
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
