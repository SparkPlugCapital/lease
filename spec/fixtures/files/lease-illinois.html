        <p>This Self-Storage Rental Agreement (this “Lease”) is executed at the place and on the date set forth below, between <span class="strong">Red Dot Storage 1, LLC</span>, an Illinois limited liability company (“Lessor,” which term shall also include its agents and employees), and <span id="occupant_name_2">________________________</span> (“Lessee”), and is made subject to the terms and conditions set forth below in this Lease and all rules and regulations posted at the Facility (as defined below), which terms, conditions, rules and regulations are incorporated herein and made a part hereof for all purposes. In consideration of the covenants, conditions, and agreements hereinafter contained to be kept and performed by Lessee, Lessor does hereby lease to Lessee and Lessee hereby leases from Lessor the storage space number <span id="space_number_2">__________</span> (the “Space”) located at <span id="facility_address_2">5750 Sandy Hollow Road</span>, <span id="facility_city_2">Rockford</span>, <span id="facility_state_2">IL</span> <span id="facility_zip_2">61109</span> (the “Facility”).</p>
        
        <ol class="termsList">
            <li>
                <strong>TERM:</strong> This Lease shall be for a month-to-month term commencing on the rental agreement date listed above and continuing to but not including the same day of each succeeding month (or, for any calendar month having fewer days than the numerical day of the month on which this Lease begins, to but not including the last day of that calendar month) until termination. Each monthly period described in this article shall be called a “Rental Month.”
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>RENT:</strong> Lessee shall pay the above monthly rent punctually on the monthly rent payment date set forth above. NO MONTHLY BILLS OR STATEMENT WILL BE SENT TO LESSEE. In addition to Lessor’s other rights and remedies, Lessor may assess reasonable charges if Lessee defaults hereunder including charges for (a) delinquent payment of rent, (b) return of a check that is not honored, (c) failure to deliver possession upon termination, (d) failure to remove property upon termination and (e) other reasons set forth in this Lease, including the Rules and Regulations. If any monthly Installment is not paid when due, or if any check given in payment is dishonored, Lessee shall be deemed to be in default. <strong>If rent is not paid within five (5) days of the due date, Lessor may, without notice, deny Lessee access to the property located in the Facility.</strong> Additionally, if Lessee is renting more than one Space at any given time, default on one rented Space shall constitute default on all rented Spaces, entitling Lessor to deny access to Lessee to all rented Spaces. All service charges, administrative fees, default notice charges, late charges, court costs and attorneys’ fees together with all other fees and charges set forth in this Lease incurred by Lessor in connection with the enforcement of this Lease shall be deemed “additional rent” payable by Lessee to Lessor as provided in this Lease. In addition to the Monthly Rent, Lessee shall pay all state and local sales taxes as may be assessed by the jurisdiction where the Property is located.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>USE OF THE SPACE:</strong> The space named herein is to be used by Lessee solely for the purpose of storing any personal property belonging to Lessee. If so equipped, Lessee shall not store any property within eighteen (18) inches of the clearance of any fire sprinkler head and agrees that, at Lessee’s sole cost and expense, Lessor may remove any property within such distance of a fire sprinkler head. Lessee agrees not to store any hazardous substances, explosives or any highly flammable goods or any other goods in the space which would cause danger to the space. Lessee agrees that the Space will not be used for any unlawful purpose and Lessee agrees not to commit waste, nor alter, nor affix signs on the space, and to keep the space in good condition during the term of this Lease. Lessee agrees not to store jewels, furs, heirlooms, art works, collectibles or other irreplaceable items having special or emotional value to Lessee. Lessee hereby waives any claim for sentimental value or emotional distress for Lessee’s emotional attachment to any property that is stored in the Space or on the Facility. There shall be NO HABITABLE OCCUPANCY of the space by humans or pets of any kind for any period whatsoever and violation of these prohibitions shall be grounds for immediate TERMINATION of this Lease.
                <br/><br/>
                If hazardous substances are stored, used, generated, or disposed of in the Space or on the Facility, or if the Space or the Facility shall become contaminated in any manner for which Lessee is directly or indirectly responsible, Lessee shall indemnify, defend and hold Lessor harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, fines, judgments, penalties, costs, liabilities, or losses, and any and all sums incurred or paid for settlement of arising out of any contamination by Lessee, whether incurred during or after this Lease term. Lessee agrees not to conduct any business out of the Space and further agrees that the Space is not to be used for any type of work shop, for any type of repairs, or for any sales, renovations, decoration, painting, or other contracting. No mechanical work of any nature is permitted in the Space, the Facility or the grounds.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>LIMITATION OF VALUE: Lessee agrees that in no event shall the total value of all property stored be deemed to exceed $5,000 unless Lessor has given permission in writing for Lessee to store property exceeding $5,000 in value, and Lessee has provided proof of insurance to Lessor to cover the value of the stored property.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>LESSEE LOCK:</strong> Lessee shall keep the Space locked at all times, using only one lock per door. All necessary locks shall be provided by Lessee at Lessee’s sole cost and expense. If Lessee fails to lock the Space, Lessor may lock the Space with Lessor’s lock and deny access to Lessee until Lessee provides a suitable lock. Under no circumstances shall Lessor be deemed under any obligation to lock the Space, nor shall Lessor incur any liability whatsoever as a result of any failure of Lessor to exercise its right to lock the Space. In the event Lessor exercises its right hereunder to lock the Space with Lessor’s lock, Lessee shall be assessed an additional charge to be paid as additional rent for each such incident.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>PERMISSION TO CALL, FAX, E-MAIL OR TEXT:</strong> Lessee recognizes Lessor and Lessee are entering to a business relationship as Lessor and Lessee. As such, to the extent any Federal or State law prohibits Lessor from contacting Lessee by phone, fax, e-mail or text, Lessee hereby consents to Lessor phoning, faxing, e-mailing and texting Lessee with marketing and/or other business related communications.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>NONLIABILITY OF LESSOR:</strong> The parties acknowledge and agree that Lessee has in no way delivered or relinquished exclusive possession of the property stored or used in the Space by entering into this Lease, and Lessee’s control and dominion over such property is dependent in no degree upon the cooperation of Lessor. Lessor shall not be liable for loss damages or injury caused by any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to theft, water, fire, mysterious disappearance, mold, mildew, vandalism, smoke, flood, hurricanes, rain, tornadoes, explosions, rodents, insects, birds or other animals, acts of God, the failure to keep the Buildings or grounds under repair, or for the acts or neglect of Lessor, or lessees of other self-storage space, or of any other persons. <strong>All property stored or used within the Space or the Facility by Lessee shall be at Lessee’s sole risk.</strong> Lessor is not a warehouseman engaged in the business of storing goods for hire, and no bailment is created by this Lease. Lessor exercises neither care, custody, nor control over Lessee’s stored property. <strong>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LESSEE SHALL NOT ASSERT AND HEREBY WAIVES ANY CLAIM AGAINST LESSOR ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (AS OPPOSED TO DIRECT OR ACTUAL DAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF, IN CONNECTION WITH, OR AS A RESULT OF THIS LEASE OR ANY AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, OR THE USE OF THE SPACE OR ENTRANCE ON THE FACILITY. LESSEE AGREES THAT THE MAXIMUM VALUE FOR ANY CLAIM OR SUIT BY LESSEE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY SUIT THAT ALLEGES WRONGFUL OR IMPROPER FORECLOSURE OR SALE OF THE CONTENTS OF THE SPACE, IS $5,000. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION OR ANY PART OF THIS LEASE SHALL BE DEEMED TO CREATE ANY LIABILITY ON THE PART OF LESSOR TO LESSEE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE TO LESSEE&#39;S PROPERTY, REGARDLESS OF CAUSE. LESSEE REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT HE HAS READ AND UNDERSTANDS THIS SECTION AND AGREES THAT IT IS VALID, ENFORCEABLE, AND NOT UNCONSCIONABLE.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>RIGHT TO ENTER:</strong> In the event of an emergency, or upon request of a governmental authority, Lessor or Lessor’s agents, or representatives of any governmental authority, shall have the right to remove Lessee’s lock and enter the Space, without notice to Lessee, and take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to preserve the Space, to comply with applicable law, or enforce any of Lessor’s rights, including removal of materials stored in violation of this Lease. Further, Lessor may relocate Lessee’s property to a comparable unit within the Facility if such relocation is necessary to repair, maintain, service, reconfigure or otherwise perform work on the units, buildings or grounds.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>LESSEE INSURANCE. LESSOR DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY TYPE OF INSURANCE THAT WOULD PROTECT LESSEE'S PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM LOSS OR DAMAGE BY FIRE, THEFT, OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF CASUALTY. IT IS LESSEE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO OBTAIN SUCH INSURANCE.</strong> Lessee, at Lessee's expense, shall secure insurance to protect himself and his property against all perils of whatever nature for the actual cash value of the stored property. Insurance on Lessee&#39;s property is a material condition of this Lease. Lessee shall make no claim whatsoever against Lessor&#39;s insurance in the event of any loss. Lessee, on behalf of himself as well as any insurer of his property, agrees not to subrogate against Lessor in the event of loss or damage of any kind or from any cause. The proceeds of any insurance which may be carried by Lessor against loss or damage to its building, its contents fixtures or improvements situated adjacent thereto or to the grounds shall be payable solely to Lessor or its mortgagee. Lessee may cancel the insurance plan made available by Lessor at any time if evidence of third party insurance over the stored property is provided to Lessor.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>PERSONAL INJURY:</strong> Lessor and Lessor’s agents and employees shall not be liable whatsoever to any extent to Lessee or Lessee’s invitees, family, employees, agents or servants for any personal injury or death arising from Lessee’s use of the Space or entry to the Facility from any cause whatsoever including, but not limited to, the active or passive acts or omissions or negligence of Lessor, Lessor’s agents, or employees.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>CONDITION OF SPACE:</strong> The Space is leased herein AS IS, WHERE IS at the date hereof. Lessee understands that all unit sizes are approximate and enters into this Lease without reliance on the estimated size of the Space. At the expiration of the term hereof, Lessee shall surrender the Space, broom clean and in good repair, order and condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted. If Lessee fails to keep the Space in good repair, order and condition throughout the term of this Lease, or fails to surrender the Space broom clean and in good repair, order and condition, normal wear and tear excepted, Lessor may in addition to all other available remedies take whatever steps Lessor deems appropriate to clean the Space or to restore the Space to good repair, order and condition, and Lessee shall reimburse Lessor for Lessor’s reasonable expenses in connection therewith. Lessee shall not make any alterations or additions to the Space nor operate in the Space or any part of the Facility, or on the grounds, any power appliances or devices of any kind without, in each case, the prior written consent of Lessor and on the terms and conditions specified in such written consent.
                <br/><br/>
                Should Lessee damage or depreciate the Space or the Facility, or make alterations or improvements without the prior consent of Lessor, or require Lessor to incur costs to clean the Space upon termination or during the term of this Lease, then all costs necessary to restore the space to its prior condition shall be borne by Lessee. Lessor has the right to declare any such costs to repair as “rent” and non-payment of said costs will entitle Lessor to deny Lessee access to the Space.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>PARTIAL PAYMENTS:</strong> Lessee agrees and understands that partial payments made to cure a default for non-payment of rent will not delay or stop the sale of Lessee’s property. Partial payments do not waive or avoid the legal effect of prior notices given to Lessee. Only full payment on Lessee’s account prior to the published auction date will stop the scheduled sale of the property.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>LESSOR’S LIEN: LESSOR SHALL HAVE A LIEN ON ALL PERSONAL PROPERTY STORED IN THE SPACE FOR RENT, LABOR OR OTHER CHARGES, PRESENT AND FUTURE, IN RELATION TO THE PERSONAL PROPERTY AND THE EXPENSES NECESSARY FOR ITS PRESERVATION OR EXPENSES REASONABLY INCURRED IN ITS SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION PURSUANT TO THE “ILLINOIS SELF SERVICE STORAGE FACILITY ACT” 770 ILCS 95/1-95/7.10. THE LIEN PROVIDED HEREUNDER ATTACHES AS OF THE DATE THAT THE PERSONAL PROPERTY IS BROUGHT TO THE FACILITY. IN ADDITION TO ALL OTHER REMEDIES AVAILABLE AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, LESSOR MAY ENFORCE ITS LIEN BY SELLING OR OTHERWISE DISPOSING OF THE PERSONAL PROPERTY STORED IN THE SPACE. IN NO EVENT SHALL LESSOR’S LIABILITY EXCEED THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE. THIS LIEN COVERS ANY PERSONAL PROPERTY WHICH LESSEE STORES IN THE SPACE, EVEN IF IT IS OWNED BY SOMEONE OTHER THAN LESSEE.</strong> If the property upon which the lien is claimed is a vehicle or watercraft, and rent and other charges related to the property remain unpaid or unsatisfied for sixty (60) days, Lessor may have the property towed from the Facility. A sale described above does not release Lessee from the obligations for amounts remaining uncollected.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>INDEMNIFICATION OF LESSOR.</strong> Lessee shall defend, indemnify and hold Lessor and its agents harmless from and against any and all manner of claims and demands for damages, lost or damaged property, or injury, and against all losses, penalties and expenses, including Lessor's reasonable costs and attorney&#39;s fees, arising from Lessee&#39;s lease of the Space, from any act or omission of Lessee, from the violation of any statute or ordinance by Lessee, or from any accident or occurrence due directly or indirectly to use or occupancy of the Space by Lessee, including, without limitation, any breach of Lessee&#39;s covenants with respect to hazardous materials, substances or wastes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>NOTICE REGARDING SECURITY SYSTEMS:</strong> Lessee acknowledges that Lessor may, but shall not be obligated to, arrange for the installation of an alarm system on the Facility. In such event, Lessee agrees that such services shall be for Lessor’s sole benefit, and that Lessor shall not have the responsibility for maintaining or operating such alarm system. <strong>ACCORDINGLY, NEITHER LESSOR, THE ALARM SERVICE, THE ALARM PROVIDER, OR ANY OTHER PERSON SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO LESSEE OR ANY OTHER PERSON (INCLUDING LESSEE’S INSURER) IN THE EVENT SUCH ALARM SYSTEM, OR ANY COMPONENT THEREOF, SHALL FAIL OR MALFUNCTION (INCLUDING ANY FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION BASED ON OR ARISING FROM THE NEGLIGENT ACTS OF LESSOR, ITS AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES). LESSEE HEREBY WAIVES ALL CLAIMS AND RIGHTS OF SUBROGATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY LOSSES LESSEE MIGHT INCUR ARISING FROM SUCH A FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION.</strong> This waiver also applies to any systems installed by Lessor to secure the Facility and includes, but is not limited to: gates, fences, cameras, doors, etc. shall be for Lessor’s sole benefit, and that Lessor shall not have the responsibility for maintaining or operating such alarm system.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>ACCESS:</strong> Lessor may (but shall be under no obligation to) provide automatic access doors, elevators or electronic entry devices. Notwithstanding installation of such devices, Lessor shall in no event be liable for any damages or injury caused by Lessee’s inability to move between floors or an elevator or to gain access to, or exit from the Facility, whether because of mechanical or other electrical failure of the elevators, automatic access doors or electronic entry devices, or for any other reason. Access will be denied to any party other than Lessee who does not retain gate code and key to any lock on the Space or has failed to supply Lessor with written authorization from Lessee to enter the Space. Lessee’s access to the Facility may also be conditioned in any manner deemed reasonably necessary by Lessor to maintain order and security on the Facility. Such measures may include, but are not limited to, restricting hours of operation, requiring verification of Lessee’s identity and inspecting vehicles that enter the Facility.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>CONFESSION OF JUDGMENT:</strong> Lessee hereby irrevocably constitutes any attorney or any court of record of this state to enter Lessee’s appearance in such court, waive process and service thereof, and confess judgment from time to time, for any amounts which may be due to Lessor, by the terms of this Lease, with costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, and to waive all errors and right of appeals from said judgment and to file a consent in writing that a proper writ of execution may be used immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>ASSIGNMENT:</strong> Lessee may not assign this Lease or any rights hereunder, or sublet the Space without the prior written consent of Lessor.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>TERMINATION:</strong> This Lease shall continue from month to month unless Lessee or Lessor delivers to the other party a written notice of its intentions to terminate this Lease at least five (5) days prior to the end of the current rental month. Lessor reserves the right to terminate this Lease immediately upon default by Lessee of any terms of this Lease. Lessee shall remove all personal property from the space and shall deliver possession of the space to Lessor no later than the end of the current rental month unless such property is subject to Lessor’s lien rights as referenced in this Lease. If Lessee fails to fully remove its property from the space within the time required, Lessor, at its option, may without further notice or demand, either directly or through legal process, reenter the Space and remove all property therefrom without being deemed guilty in any manner of trespassing or conversion. if Lessee abandons the Space, Lessor shall have the right to automatically terminate this Lease. Lessee shall have abandoned the space if Lessee has removed the contents of the space, and/or has removed Lessee’s locking device from the space and IS NOT current in all obligations hereunder. Rent paid for the month in which Lessee moves out early shall not be refunded.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>WAIVER/ENFORCEABILITY:</strong> In the event any part of this Lease shall be held invalid or unenforceable the remaining part of this Lease shall be in full force and effect as though any invalid or unenforceable part or parts were not written into this Lease. No waiver by Lessor of any provisions hereof shall be deemed a waiver of any other provision hereof or of any subsequent default or breach by Lessee of the same or any other provision.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL:</strong> LESSOR AND LESSEE WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM, OR CROSS COMPLAINT BROUGHT BY EITHER LESSOR AGAINST LESSEE, OR LESSEE AGAINST LESSOR ON ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS LEASE, LESSEE’S USE OR OCCUPANCY OF THE SPACE, OR ANY CLAIM OF BODILY INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE OR THE ENFORCEMENT OF ANY REMEDY UNDER ANY LAW, STATUTE, OR REGULATION.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>LESSEE’S LIABILITY:</strong> In the event of a foreclosure of Lessee’s interest in the Space, it is understood and agreed that the liability of Lessee for the rents, charges, costs and expenses provided for in this Lease shall not be relinquished, diminished or extinguished prior to payment in full. Lessor may use a collection agency thereafter to secure any remaining balance owed by Lessee after the application of sale proceeds, if any. If any property of Lessee remains unsold after foreclosure and sale, Lessor may dispose of said property in any manner considered appropriate by Lessor, and Lessor may charge Lessee a reasonable disposal fee, which shall be a minimum of $25.00.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>MERGER; LIMITED WARRANTY:</strong> This Lease contains the entire agreement of the parties and no representation or agreements, oral, or otherwise, between the parties not embodied herein shall be of any force or effect. The agents and employees of Lessor are not authorized or permitted to make any warranties about the Space, the Property, or any facilities referred to in this Lease. Lessor’s agents and employees’ ORAL STATEMENTS DO NOT CONSTITUTE WARRANTIES and shall not be relied upon by Lessee. The entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto are embodied in this writing and NO OTHER WARRANTIES are given.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>LESSEE PRIVACY:</strong> Lessor shall not disclose Lessee information to other persons or companies for marketing purposes other than internal use by Lessor or one of its affiliates.
